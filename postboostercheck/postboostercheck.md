**NOTE**: The Navigation Service is created manually after the Joule booster execution and the other 4 destinationsare created automatically by the booster.  The names of the Designtime and Runtime destinations are auto generated by the booster and may not match the screenshot shown.  You may also see additional destinations in the list if Joule booster was also executed for other SAP solutions besides S/4HANA Public Cloud
